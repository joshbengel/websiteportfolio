			<h2> <em> About Me </em></h2>
			<article id="about_me">
				<p> 
					<!-- Paragraph one -->
					I am 23 years old and live in Oceanside, NY. I grew up on Long Island and attended Oceanside Senior High School, graduating with Honors in June of 2014.
					<span style="background-color: yellow; border:thin solid black;">I then went on to Temple University, where I spent four years studying Mathematics and Computer Science with Teaching. After graduating in May 2018, with a 3.5 GPA and as part of the University Honors Program, I moved back to Oceanside. </span>
					Upon moving back to my hometown, I started my full time job at Long Island Children's Museum as the Together to Kindergarten Program Coordinator/ Visitor Experience Coordinator.
					I started at the museum in May of 2015 as an intern with the Together to Kindergarten (TTK) Program, and in this new role I am responsible for all aspects of the Kindergarten Readiness Program. 
					I help to develop curriculum, to create the bus route, teach the children, work with the families and supervise the other educators working for the program. 
					I also am a Visitor Experience Coordinator: responsible for maintaining the museum's daily operations, being an inter-department liason and have taken a big part in the Museum's volunteer efforts. 
				</p>
		
				<p>
					<!--Paragraph two -->
					I also currently work with a tutoring agency on Long Island, helping local middle and high school students in the areas of mathematics and physics. 
					While working in education is very rewarding, my interests and focus has changed a lot over the past year. That is why I am now looking to increase my technical and coding skills and change career paths to focus more on software development.
					<strong>I currenlty speak both English and Spanish, I can read Hebrew and have a good basic knowledge of several coding languages (Java, Python, C++).</strong>

			<h2> <em>Past Experiences </em> </h2>
			<article id="past_experiences">
				<p> 
					During high school and early college I worked at the Sands Atlantic Beach Club in the food court as a cashier. While this was a great first job, after my first year of college I also got an internship at Long Island Children's Museum. 
					The following year, I left the beach club and focused on my work at the museum. I was an educator on the floor, in the TTK Classroom as well as a children's birthday party host. 
					Going back to school, I briefly worked for a catering company and focused on my studies. During my fourth and final year at Temple University, I was a student teacher at Frankford High School in North Philadelphia. 
				</p>
			
				<p>
					During my studies, I took a variety of Computer Science Courses including python development, java development, c++ development and mathematics in computing. These experiences in these courses have given me a great foundation of computer science. 
					Additionally, the summer after my sophmore year of college, I worked at Oceanside High School with a previous teacher of mine to develop curriculum for their new AP Computer Science Principals course.
					<strong>On my own, I also started to examine HTML after being tasked with maintaining and updating the Museum's website.</strong> Every month I create the daily events, making sure to include the appropriate pictures, description and sponsers (if applicable).

			<h2> <em> Hobbies </em></h2>
			<article id="hobbies">
				<p> 
					I have a variety of interests, but I really enjoy spending time outside and working on my cars/truck. <span style="background-color: lightgreen; border: dotted black;">I am an avid runner, hiker and seasonal sport enthusiast. Living on Long Island has allowed me to learn and discover a love for surfing. 
					Long Island is also not far from some great mountains, where I have spent time almost every season.</span> Hiking during the warmer months and skiing during the colder months. 
					Along with physical activity, I enjoy fixing and modifying whatever car I currenlty own. I learned how to drive stick shift when I was 18, and have restored a Jeep Wrangler. I take care of all the maintence on all my families cars and am known to be the one to help get a good deal when car shopping. 
				</p>
			
				<p>
					While I do love staying physically active and spending time outside, I would be remiss to leave out a big part of my life outside of work- <strong>I am a volunteer firefighter </strong>. When I moved back to Long Island, I joined my town's volunteer fire department. 
					While it has only been a year, I have learned a lot- both about firefighting and the community in which I live. It has been a great honor to serve my community, help those in need and be part of a great group of people. 
					I have challenged myself both physically and mentally, while learning about things I thought you only saw on television.
